CI / CD - CD


Environments??


Servers 

Development Envrionment ---> to do the code development Java Web Application -

Build Environment ---> Used to build the application and create artifacts.(binaries) *.war/*.jar/*.dll

Testing Environment ---> Actually test the Application.
	QA / UAT / Pre-Prod / Staging

Production Environment
*.war/*.jar.v1.1


Non-Prod Environment:
DEV /--> QA /--> UAT /--> Pre-Prod / Staging

DEV 


Prod Environment:
Prod

Infra-structure Team:


DevOps 

CI -

C.Delivery - is automated in non-prod environments

C.Deployment - is automated in throughout non-prod & Prod environments
 

All about :

People
Process
Tools 


ALM -- used to track end-to-end project activities...

Continouous Monitoring ? for Continuous Improvement!

Monitor the network, Hacking 



Day-2:

Version Control System -

Continuous Development -

Development tools like IDE - Eg.: Eclipse, Visual studio Code

Use the IDE to develop the code.

index.html

saved in his whole machine.

All that I need is a common repository or a system where I can save my source code and share it with other developers

It is also needed to track the changes.

Version Control System!

index.html ---> version v1.0
index.html ---> version v1.2
index.html ---> version v1.3
index.html ---> version v1.4

prod. deployment

Distributed version control system:

GIT :::

file1.txt
rec1
rec2
rec3

save - file1.txt -- v1.0
rec4
rec5

save - file1.txt -- v1.2
save - file1.txt -- 


d:/folder/file1.txt   ---> physical Location ( workspace )

git repository!

can be version controlled!

Installation!

Local Machine... Visual Studio code (IDE), GIT.

AWS - Create a virtual Machine (linux) and install git.




Workspace

f1.txt
f2.txt

f3.txt
f4.txt

Staging Area

f1.txt
f2.txt
f3.txt
f4.txt

Local Repo.

f1.txt
f2.txt

git push 

Remote Repo.

f1.txt
f2.txt



Git fetch ---> updates the local repo. + git checkout

git pull  ---> Updates the local Repo. as well as workspace

git pull ==> git fetch & git checkout





Developer A ---> created 10 files f1.txt ----- f10.txt   ---> pushed all these files to remote repo.


Developer B ---> git pull  (local repo & workspace)

            ---> git fetch (local repo with all the changes from remote) 

	         git checkout (f1,f2,f3)

		 git add f1.txt
		 git commit 
		 git push 
	




git:

clone
add
commit
push
pull
fetch
